        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Yehoshua Cohen (Shui), a passionate full-stack web development student with a deep interest in programming. Ever since I started exploring the world of code, I knew that full-stack development was the best path for me. The versatility it offers, allowing me to build both the front-end and back-end of applications, keeps me constantly engaged and eager to learn.</p><br>
        <p>I began my full-stack journey in late July 2024, and in just a few months, I’ve gained a solid foundation in key technologies like Python, JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS. These skills have enabled me to create dynamic and functional web applications, and I’m excited to further expand my knowledge as I dive into React next week.</p><br>
        <p>I believe in continuously challenging myself, and I’m always on the lookout for opportunities to grow and refine my skills. Full-stack development gives me the chance to combine logic with creativity, and I can’t wait to take on more complex projects as I advance in this field.</p><br>
        <p>Stay tuned as I continue to build out my portfolio with new and exciting projects!</p>
